Please read the following:

  - Always test with current git master before opening a feature request
  - Use the search function to see if the feature you're about to request isn't a duplicate. If an existing issue is open and you have new information, update it
  - One feature/topic request per ticket
  - Don't worry about any of the items on the right panel (Assignee, Labels or Milestone), we will take care of them
